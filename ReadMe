# Project Title

This is a Java-based project that uses the Spring Boot framework and Maven for dependency management. The project is designed to interact with the GitHub API and Kafka.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Java 19
- Maven
- Spring Boot
- Kafka
- Docker

### Installing

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `mvn clean install` to build the project and install the dependencies.

## Running the Application

## Project Structure

The project consists of several key components:

- `KafkaProducerConfig`: This class is responsible for the configuration of the Kafka producer. It sets up the producer factory and Kafka template beans.

- `GithubAPIController`: This class is a REST controller that interacts with the GitHub API. It fetches pull requests from a specified repository and publishes them to a Kafka topic.

- `Utils`: This class contains utility methods, such as `getTodayMidnight()`, which returns the current date at midnight in the "America/Toronto" timezone.

- `PullRequest` and `Label`: These are model classes that represent the structure of a pull request and label respectively in the GitHub API.
